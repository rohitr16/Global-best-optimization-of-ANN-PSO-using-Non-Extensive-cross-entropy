# Global-best-optimization-of-ANN-PSO-using-Non-Extensive-cross-entropy

Descirption

 In this repository, we particularly focused on ANN trained by Particle Swarm Optimization (ANN-PSO), in which the local-best and global-best particle positions represent possible solutions to the set of network weights. The global-best position of the swarm, which corresponds to the minimum cost function over time, is determined in our work by minimizing a new non-extensive cross-entropy error cost function.
